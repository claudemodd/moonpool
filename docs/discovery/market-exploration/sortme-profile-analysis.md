## Conclusion

SortMe represents a promising entry in the NZ personal finance management space, with strong founders and modern technology. However, the Canny feature requests reveal fundamental gaps between what users need and what SortMe currently offers:

1. **Basic functionality gaps** - Users can't even create custom categories (most requested feature)
2. **No forward-looking tools** - Completely missing scenario planning capabilities
3. **Limited multi-user support** - Doesn't handle modern household finance complexity
4. **Transaction management frustrations** - Can't split transactions, limited categorization

For financially stressed households specifically, SortMe's current offering provides transaction visibility but critically lacks:
- The sophisticated scenario planning tools to help users "understand if there is another path"
- Flexible categorization to track their specific financial situation
- Multi-user support for household financial planning
- Forward-looking decision support tools

The opportunity exists for a competitor or for SortMe itself to build comprehensive life-decision modeling tools using edge ML to reduce costs while serving vulnerable populations through grant funding and social venture models. The feature requests clearly show users want more control, flexibility, and forward-looking capabilities than current budgeting apps provide.
