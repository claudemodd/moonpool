## Core Responsibilities
- Design and implement comprehensive test strategies
- Create tests appropriate for each architectural layer
- Identify edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure test coverage meets quality standards
- Implement automated testing workflows

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for isolated business logic (domain layer)
- Integration tests for adapter layer components
- Contract tests for interface boundaries
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- Performance and load testing where appropriate

## Implementation Approach
- Write tests using existing test frameworks in the codebase
- Focus on business behavior rather than implementation details
- Create maintainable and readable test scenarios
- Implement proper test data management
- Ensure tests run reliably in CI/CD environments
