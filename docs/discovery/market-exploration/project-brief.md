# Project Moonpool brief

## Purpose of Project Moonpool

Project Moonpool is Hypha Lab's open finance platform that reimagines personal financial management for the modern reality. We're building an intelligent system that enriches financial data with real-world context, structures it semantically for AI agents, and provides conversational access to holistic financial insights.

Our platform moves beyond traditional budgeting tools to address the complex trade-offs between time, money, energy, and wellbeing that define contemporary financial life.

## Problem statement

Traditional personal financial management tools are fundamentally obsolete because they:

- **Assume outdated patterns**: Built for stable, predictable income when most people face volatile markets and multiple income streams
- **Ignore true costs**: Focus only on monetary transactions whilst ignoring the cost of time, energy, and wellbeing
- **Fail to adapt**: Provide static budgets and reports when financial reality requires daily adaptation to market changes
- **Extract value from vulnerability**: Use dark patterns and exploit users' financial stress rather than genuinely helping
- **Miss life complexity**: Cannot model major decisions like housing optimisation, energy market shifts, or life events

Modern financial life involves volatile markets requiring daily adaptation, complex trade-offs between resources, life decisions with long-term implications, multiple income streams with irregular expenses, and energy costs becoming a major financial factor.

## Our hypothesis

We believe that by enriching financial data with real-world context and providing conversational AI access, we can create the first truly helpful personal finance platform for the modern era.

### Core hypothesis

**If** we enrich financial data with energy markets, time economics, and life event context, **and** structure this data semantically for AI agents, **then** we can provide genuinely useful financial insights that help people navigate complex modern financial decisions.

### Key innovation areas

**Holistic financial health beyond bank balances:**
- Time economics: Calculating real hourly rates and work requirements
- Energy cost optimisation: Real-time adaptation to energy market volatility  
- Housing decisions: Rent vs buy analysis for specific contexts
- Life event modelling: Financial impact forecasting for major decisions

**Conversational financial intelligence:**
- Natural language interaction with enriched financial data
- AI agents that understand context, nuance, and personal circumstances
- Proactive insights rather than reactive reports
- Adaptive interventions based on behaviour patterns and goals

**Sustainable privacy model:**
- Transparent data use policies without exploitation
- Synthetic data generation enabling innovation whilst protecting privacy
- Sustainable free tier without advertisements or dark patterns
- User empowerment rather than dependency creation

### Market opportunity

We're targeting the gap between traditional banking tools (focused on transactions) and budgeting apps (focused on spending limits) by creating a platform that helps people understand and optimise the relationship between their resources: time, money, energy, and wellbeing.

## Next steps for refinement

This brief would benefit from additional development in several areas:

1. **Target market definition**: Who specifically are we serving? Demographic profiles, use cases, and market size
2. **Success metrics**: How will we measure whether our hypothesis is correct?
3. **Technical approach**: High-level architecture and implementation strategy
4. **Competitive landscape**: How do we differentiate from existing solutions?
5. **Business model**: Revenue streams that align with our privacy and sustainability principles
6. **Risk assessment**: What could prevent our hypothesis from being viable?
7. **Timeline and milestones**: Development phases and validation checkpoints
