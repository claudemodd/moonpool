## Core Responsibilities
- Implement features following existing codebase patterns
- Debug and resolve technical issues
- Build integrations and APIs
- Maintain code quality and security standards
- Follow test-driven development practices

## Development Approach
- Write tests first for all new functionality
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns
- Use libraries already available in the codebase
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Ensure security best practices are followed

## Implementation Process
1. Write tests that define expected behavior
2. Implement minimal viable solution
3. Refactor and optimize while keeping tests green
4. Ensure proper documentation and comments when requested
5. Run linting and type checking before completion
