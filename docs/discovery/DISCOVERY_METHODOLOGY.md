# Discovery Methodology Guide

**Based on Domain-Driven Discovery best practices adapted for maximum exploration flexibility**

## Four-Phase Discovery Process

### Phase 1: Problem Framing
**Objective:** Clarify the problem space before diving into solutions

**Key Activities:**
- Define problem, target people, desired outcomes, and constraints
- Avoid jumping to technical solutions
- Focus on "why" questions over "how" questions
- Document assumptions to test later

**Deliverables:**
- Problem statement
- Target audience definition
- Success criteria
- Constraint documentation

### Phase 2: Current State Exploration
**Objective:** Understand the existing landscape and competitive environment

**Key Activities:**
- Market research and competitive analysis
- User behavior analysis
- Technology landscape mapping
- Business model research
- Stakeholder interviews

**Research Techniques:**
- Event storming sessions (for understanding workflows)
- Competitive feature analysis
- User journey mapping
- Technology stack analysis
- Business model canvas creation

**Deliverables:**
- Market landscape documentation
- Competitive analysis
- Current state workflow maps
- Technology assessment

### Phase 3: Future State Ideation
**Objective:** Explore multiple solution approaches without constraints

**Key Activities:**
- Brainstorming solution concepts
- Exploring multiple approaches
- User needs analysis
- Feature ideation workshops
- Business model innovation

**Now/Next/Later Framework:**
- **Now:** Immediate opportunities and low-hanging fruit
- **Next:** Medium-term strategic initiatives
- **Later:** Long-term vision and ambitious goals

**Deliverables:**
- Solution concept documentation
- Feature prioritization matrix
- User story mapping
- Business model options

### Phase 4: Validation Planning
**Objective:** Define how to test and validate key assumptions

**Key Activities:**
- Hypothesis formation
- Validation experiment design
- Success metric definition
- Risk assessment
- User research planning

**Deliverables:**
- Assumption documentation
- Validation experiment plan
- Success metrics definition
- Risk assessment matrix

## Discovery Principles

### Embrace the "Novice" Mindset
- Ask open-ended questions as if starting with zero knowledge
- Challenge assumptions regularly
- Be curious about tangential insights
- Listen more than you speak

### Stay Problem-Focused
- Resist early solution fixation
- Spend 70% of time on problem understanding
- Validate problem significance before solution exploration
- Keep asking "Is this problem worth solving?"

### Enable Collaborative Exploration
- Use visual collaboration tools (whiteboards, sticky notes)
- Include diverse perspectives in discovery sessions
- Document all ideas, even seemingly unrelated ones
- Create safe spaces for wild ideas

### Maintain Exploration Flexibility
- Don't enforce rigid documentation standards
- Allow for messy, iterative thinking
- Keep multiple solution options open
- Avoid premature convergence

## Discovery Tools and Templates

### Market Research Template
- Market size analysis (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Competitive landscape mapping
- Trend analysis and future projections
- Regulatory environment assessment

### User Research Template
- User interview guides
- Survey design frameworks
- Persona development worksheets
- Journey mapping canvases

### Business Model Exploration
- Lean Canvas iterations
- Value proposition design
- Revenue model options
- Cost structure analysis

### Technical Exploration
- Technology landscape mapping
- Integration point identification
- Scalability consideration framework
- Technical risk assessment

## Transition to Validation

**When Discovery is Complete:**
- Problem is clearly defined and validated
- Market opportunity is quantified
- User needs are well understood
- Multiple solution approaches have been explored
- Key assumptions are documented

**Handoff to Validation Phase:**
- Package discovery findings for agent review
- Translate insights into business requirements
- Identify domain concepts that emerged during exploration
- Prepare for terminology standardization process

**Remember:** Discovery is about exploring the problem and solution space with complete freedom. Domain modeling constraints apply ONLY during validation and domain phases.
