# Writing standards for all projects

## Primary formatting rule
Always use sentence case for all headers and titles.

## Language standards
- **Use British English**: behaviour, colour, organisation, realise, centre
- **Active voice**: "Configure the API" instead of "The API can be configured"
- **Be concise**: Write scannable content with bullet points and short paragraphs
- **Use human language**: Write in a conversational but professional and concise tone

## Documentation structure
- Start each document with clear purpose
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include practical examples, not abstract concepts
- Write for diverse audiences and experience levels

## Quality requirements
- All headers use sentence case
- Proper nouns capitalised correctly
- British English spelling throughout
- Links functional and relevant
- Instructions actionable and complete
