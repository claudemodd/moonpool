# Project Moonpool Domain Model

## Phase Overview

The domain phase contains **domain-driven design artifacts** that emerge from validated discovery concepts. All content here must use the ubiquitous language and follow DDD principles under Documentation Agent governance.

## Domain Contexts

### Financial Intelligence Context
*To be developed based on validated discovery findings*

**Potential Entities** (subject to validation):
- User
- FinancialProfile  
- FinancialDecision
- DataSource

**Potential Bounded Contexts**:
- UserManagement
- FinancialIntelligence
- DecisionSupport
- DataIntegration
- Privacy

### Domain Development Process

1. **Concepts validated** in validation phase
2. **Domain boundaries identified** by Platform Architect
3. **Ubiquitous language defined** by Documentation Agent
4. **Domain model developed** following DDD principles

## Directory Structure

### `/contexts/`
Bounded context definitions and boundaries
- Context mapping
- Integration patterns  
- Service boundaries
- Data ownership

### `/glossary/`
Project-specific domain glossary
- Ubiquitous language definitions established during validation
- Business term mappings from discovery translation
- Technical concept translations for implementation
- Single source of truth for domain terminology

## Agent System Integration

Domain development coordinated through Claude Code subagents:
- documentation-guardian enforces ubiquitous language
- platform-architect defines hexagonal architecture
- security-reviewer validates privacy boundaries
- backend-developer implements domain logic

## Current Status

**Phase:** Not yet initiated  
**Prerequisites:** Complete discovery and validation phases  
**Entry Criteria:** All concepts must have passed agent validation

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete discovery phase research
2. Pass validation phase reviews
3. Begin domain boundary identification
4. Establish ubiquitous language for financial intelligence domain
