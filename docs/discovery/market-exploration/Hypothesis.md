# Hypothesis

## The Problem Space

### Traditional financial tools are obsolete

Current personal financial management (PFM) tools fail because they:

- Assume stable, predictable income patterns
- Ignore the true cost of time and energy
- Fail to adapt to rapid market changes
- Extract value from vulnerable users
- Provide rigid budgets that nobody follows

### The new reality

Modern financial life involves:

- **Volatile markets** requiring daily adaptation
- **Complex trade-offs** between time, money, and wellbeing
- **Life decisions** with long-term financial implications
- **Multiple income streams** and irregular expenses
- **Energy costs** becoming a major financial factor
