# sortme SWOT analysis

## Executive summary

sortme demonstrates strong New Zealand market positioning with proven founder Carl Thompson (TradeGecko $100M exit) and deep Akahu integration. However, critical gaps in customisation and complete absence of scenario planning create significant user frustration and differentiation opportunities for competitors.

## Strengths

- **Strong founder pedigree**: Carl Thompson's proven $100M exit track record
- **Deep local integration**: Comprehensive NZ bank connectivity via Akahu
- **Generous free tier**: Substantial functionality at zero cost
- **Modern AI technology**: Susan AI chatbot for insights and recommendations
- **B2B2C model**: Financial advisor programme creating multiple revenue streams
- **Responsive development**: Daily updates and direct CTO customer support

## Weaknesses

- **Critical customisation gaps**: Cannot create custom categories (most requested feature)
- **Complete absence of scenario planning**: No forward-looking analysis tools
- **Limited budget flexibility**: Monthly-only budgeting periods
- **No multi-user support**: Cannot separate personal/joint finances
- **Small team constraints**: 6 employees limit development velocity
- **Mobile platform gaps**: Web-only, lacking native mobile apps

## Opportunities

- **NZ Open Banking 2025**: Implementation by November creates enhanced capabilities
- **Australian expansion**: Natural market extension with similar banking landscape
- **Financial planning demand**: User feedback reveals need for sophisticated planning tools
- **Grant funding availability**: Government initiatives supporting fintech development
- **Edge ML implementation**: Cost-efficient, privacy-preserving local processing
- **Social venture positioning**: Partnerships with financial inclusion initiatives

## Threats

- **Market consolidation**: Pocketbook/MoneyBrilliant closures show platform vulnerability
- **Bank competition**: Major banks developing integrated PFM capabilities
- **International competitors**: Well-funded platforms like Monarch Money expanding
- **Regulatory complexity**: Compliance requirements increasing operational burden
- **Platform dependency**: Critical reliance on Akahu creates single point of failure

## Strategic implications for Project Moonpool

sortme's feature gaps represent Project Moonpool's biggest opportunities. Complete absence of scenario planning and limited customisation create clear differentiation paths. 2025 Open Banking implementation provides optimal market entry timing for advanced capabilities.
