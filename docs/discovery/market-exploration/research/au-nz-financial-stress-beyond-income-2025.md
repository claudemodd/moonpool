# Financial stress indicators in Australia and New Zealand: Evidence beyond income levels

## Executive summary

This comprehensive research report examines financial stress patterns in Australia and New Zealand (2023-2025), demonstrating that financial stress extends significantly beyond simple income measures. Key findings reveal that 30.8% of Australian mortgage holders experience mortgage stress, including high-income households requiring $200,000+ after-tax income to avoid stress in Sydney. In New Zealand, 55% of the population reports financial struggle, with only 53% able to access emergency funds. The research confirms that financial stress affects households across all income levels through complex interactions of debt servicing costs, housing affordability, emergency fund depletion, and behavioural stress indicators.

## Key findings by theme

### 1. Debt-to-income ratios and mortgage stress thresholds

#### Australia
According to the Reserve Bank of Australia's April 2025 Financial Stability Review, household debt remains at historically elevated levels. The RBA reports that "the ratio of household debt to income was 182% in Q4 2024, tracking close to a record high." [Source: https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/fsr/2025/apr/resilience-of-australian-households-and-businesses.html]

Mortgage stress affects a substantial portion of Australian households. Roy Morgan Research found that "1,560,000 mortgage holders were 'At Risk' of mortgage stress in April 2024, representing 30.8% of mortgage holders." [Source: https://www.roymorgan.com/findings/mortgage-stress-april-2024]

High-income households are not immune to mortgage stress. Research indicates that "in Sydney, families need a minimum after-tax income of $200,000 to afford a median property worth $1.025 million without falling into mortgage stress." In Melbourne and Canberra, "households must have a take-home pay of around $150,000 to manage a mortgage on properties with average prices exceeding $760,000." [Source: https://www.mpamag.com/au/news/general/mortgage-stress-a-reality-even-for-high-income-families/474279]

APRA's November 2024 macroprudential update notes that "the level of household debt in Australia is high relative to incomes both compared with its long-term history and relative to international peers, making this a key vulnerability." [Source: https://www.apra.gov.au/update-on-apras-macroprudential-settings-november-2024]

#### New Zealand
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's May 2025 Financial Stability Report indicates that whilst "lower interest rates are easing debt-servicing costs," challenges remain with "rising unemployment and for businesses weak demand." [Source: https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/hub/publications/financial-stability-report/2025/may/fsr/financial-stability-report-may-2025]

The International Monetary Fund's 2025 assessment of New Zealand notes that "over 70 percent of mortgages are scheduled to reprice this year, with many households having shifted toward short-term fixed-rate mortgages in anticipation of monetary easing." [Source: https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2025/03/11/cs-031125-new-zealand-staff-concluding-statement-of-the-2025-article-iv-mission]

### 2. Emergency fund statistics and liquidity constraints

#### Australia
The household savings situation has deteriorated significantly. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that "the household saving ratio decreased to 4.3% from 12.6% in 2021-22" and more recently "the saving ratio is at a 17 year low - just 1.1 per cent of total disposable income." [Source: https://www.abs.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/household-financial-stress-rises-june-quarter]

Emergency fund accessibility remains a critical issue. Data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey shows "the proportion of households unable to raise emergency funds was 25.1% in 2022," with the emergency fund threshold now set at $4,000. [Source: https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/hilda]

The RBA's analysis reveals that "around 3 per cent of borrowers are currently estimated to be experiencing a cash flow shortfall, putting them at risk of falling behind on their loan repayments." Furthermore, "the share of borrowers at greater risk of falling behind on their loan – those estimated to have both a cash flow shortfall and low buffers – has decreased to around 1 per cent of all variable-rate owner-occupier borrowers." [Source: https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/fsr/2024/sep/resilience-of-australian-households-and-businesses.html]

#### New Zealand
The Financial Services Council research reveals that "only 53% of Kiwis could access $5,000 within a week in a time of emergency in 2023, down from 59% in 2022," indicating declining financial resilience. [Source: https://blog.fsc.org.nz/cost-of-living-crisis-impacting-wellbeing]

Te Ara Ahunga Ora Retirement Commission research shows "55% of New Zealanders are struggling with their financial situation - up 17% compared to February 2021 and the highest level since surveying began." [Source: https://retirement.govt.nz/news/latest-news/new-research-reveals-more-than-half-of-new-zealanders-are-struggling-with-money]

### 3. High-income household financial stress patterns

Academic research published in Australian Economic Papers (2024) by Ferdi Botha from the Melbourne Institute found that "income measures overlook important aspects of poverty and financial hardship, such as non-monetary resources or barriers." The study demonstrates that housing affordability stress affects financial wellbeing across all income levels. [Source: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8454.12340]

The Reserve Bank of Australia's January 2024 Bulletin notes that "borrowers in the highest mortgagor income quartile experienced particularly pronounced reductions in savings buffers" and "high-income borrowers were the only group that drew down notably on their offset and redraw balances over 2023." [Source: https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2024/jan/developments-in-income-and-consumption-across-household-groups.html]

Expert analysis confirms that "It's an absolute fallacy that mortgage stress wouldn't be impactful in high-income households," with data showing even affluent families struggling with debt servicing. [Source: https://www.mpamag.com/au/news/general/mortgage-stress-a-reality-even-for-high-income-families/474279]

### 4. Demographic variations in financial stress

#### Age-based variations
University of Melbourne research found that "the youngest group (ages 18-24) shows more than 40% experiencing food insecurity" and young adults face "a marked increase in difficulties meeting everyday expenses across all categories compared to 2022." [Source: https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/more-than-half-of-australians-are-only-just-making-ends-meet]

ASIC's 2024 research reveals that "young women are more likely than young men to feel stressed and overwhelmed by finances and money," with the gender gap consistent with international OECD data. [Source: https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-023mr-new-moneysmart-data-reveals-young-women-more-stressed-than-young-men-about-finances-cost-of-living/]

#### Ethnicity and location
New Zealand data shows "60% of the average population have experienced financial stress within the last year, however this was significantly higher for 18-35-year-olds at 76%, Māori at 76% and 78% of Pasifika." [Source: https://blog.fsc.org.nz/cost-of-living-crisis-impacting-wellbeing]

#### Gender differences
University of Melbourne research found "women are more likely than men to report eating less and skipping meals to save money (12.2% for women vs 8.6% for men)," with women also "more likely than men to experience difficulty paying for essential expenses, particularly health costs (15%) and food (10%)." [Source: https://education.unimelb.edu.au/news-and-events/news/2025/young-adults-just-trying-to-get-by-amid-australias-rising-living-costs]

#### Single parent households
"Single parents with children report particularly high levels of food insecurity (over 40%)" according to University of Melbourne research. Additional findings show "having a first child reduces household disposable income by an average of 23.3% for one-parent households" with "63-70% of one-parent households remaining in or entering poverty within five years of having their first child." [Source: https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/more-than-half-of-australians-are-only-just-making-ends-meet]

### 5. Behavioural indicators of financial stress

#### Debt repayment struggles
ASIC's April 2024 research found that "47% of Australian adults with debt, the equivalent of 5.8 million people, have struggled to make repayments in the last 12 months," with top reasons being "cost of living pressures, reduced income and unexpected expenses." [Source: https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-118mr-5-million-australians-have-struggled-to-make-loan-and-debt-repayments-yet-many-not-asking-for-help/]

#### Spending pattern changes
AMP research shows "just one in three working Australians indicated they were financially secure in 2024, down from half of working Australians in 2020." Behavioural changes include "three in five Australians spent less on groceries this year, two in five went without a holiday and one in three spent less time engaging in regular hobbies." [Source: https://corporate.amp.com.au/newsroom/2024/october/financial-stress-among-working-australians-at--decade-highs--]

#### Social withdrawal
Research indicates "half of those that were 'severely' or 'moderately' financially stressed spent less time with friends, two in five were more likely to internalize their stress and spent more time in isolation, while over one in three spent less time with family." [Source: https://corporate.amp.com.au/newsroom/2024/october/financial-stress-among-working-australians-at--decade-highs--]

#### Help-seeking barriers
ASIC found significant barriers to seeking assistance: "55% unaware they can ask lenders for hardship assistance" whilst emotional barriers include "51% experience anxiety and stress, 40% feel shame or embarrassment, 40% feel a sense of failure." Despite widespread struggle, "only 20% have ever sought financial hardship assistance." [Source: https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-118mr-5-million-australians-have-struggled-to-make-loan-and-debt-repayments-yet-many-not-asking-for-help/]

### 6. Recent trends (2023-2025) in household financial resilience

#### Cost of living pressures
Between March 2020 and March 2024, New Zealand "household living costs rose by around 21%-24% depending on the type of household, compared with just 6%-9% in the four years previous," with increases in "interest payments (up 89%), insurance (up 31%), food (up 23%), petrol (up 31%), and rent (up 19%)." [Source: https://www.infometrics.co.nz/article/2024-04-household-cost-of-living-pressures-still-biting]

#### Interest rate impacts
The RBA notes that "borrowers have faced substantial increases in their mortgage costs, with the majority having seen their payments increase between 30 and 50 per cent since April 2022." This has led to "the share of variable-rate owner-occupier borrowers devoting at least one-third of their income to their mortgage payments" increasing "from around 4 per cent in April 2022 to around 20 per cent in July 2023." [Source: https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/fsr/2023/oct/focus-topic-indicators-of-household-financial-stress.html]

#### Policy responses
New Zealand's central bank "appropriately eased the Official Cash Rate (OCR) four times since August 2024 by 175 bps to 3¾ percent" whilst implementing "debt-to-income limits [as] a guardrail against a buildup of risk." [Source: https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2025/03/11/cs-031125-new-zealand-staff-concluding-statement-of-the-2025-article-iv-mission]

Australia introduced Stage 3 tax cuts which "increased household income for millions of Australians over the last few months – including many mortgage holders," contributing to some reduction in mortgage stress levels. [Source: https://www.roymorgan.com/findings/9697-mortgage-stress-risk-september-2024]

## Analysis and implications

### Financial stress extends beyond income levels
The research definitively demonstrates that financial stress in Australia and New Zealand cannot be predicted by income levels alone. High-income households in major cities face mortgage stress despite substantial earnings, whilst behavioural indicators show stress manifesting across all demographic groups through spending changes, social withdrawal, and help-seeking avoidance.

### Multiple vulnerability factors
Financial stress results from complex interactions between:
- Debt servicing costs relative to income
- Housing affordability pressures
- Emergency fund accessibility
- Life stage and family structure
- Geographic location and local costs
- Cultural and demographic factors
- Behavioural and psychological responses

### Systemic nature of the challenge
With 30.8% of Australian mortgage holders and 55% of New Zealanders experiencing financial struggle, the data reveals a systemic issue affecting national economic resilience. The erosion of emergency savings buffers, combined with high debt levels and cost-of-living pressures, creates vulnerability to economic shocks across previously resilient household segments.

### Policy and market implications
Current interventions through interest rate adjustments and tax relief provide limited relief. The persistence of financial stress despite these measures suggests need for:
- Innovative financial products addressing holistic wellbeing
- Technology solutions that consider behavioural patterns
- Support systems that overcome help-seeking barriers
- Financial tools that model complex modern financial trade-offs

## Conclusion

This research confirms that financial stress in Australia and New Zealand extends far beyond simple income measures, affecting households across all demographic segments through complex interactions of debt, housing costs, emergency fund depletion, and behavioural stress responses. The evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that modern financial management tools must address these multifaceted challenges rather than relying on outdated income-based models.

The widespread nature of financial stress—affecting high-income households, young professionals, families, and diverse cultural groups—demonstrates clear market need for innovative financial wellbeing solutions that address the full complexity of modern financial life.
