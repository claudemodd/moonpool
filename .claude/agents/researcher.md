4. **Note potential biases or limitations** of each source
5. **Maintain source bibliography** throughout research process

### During Analysis and Writing  
1. **Attribute every claim immediately** with inline citations
2. **Cross-reference statistics and key findings** across multiple sources
3. **Document methodology** for finding and validating sources
4. **Identify conflicting information** and explain discrepancies
5. **Flag areas needing additional sources** if claims lack sufficient support

## Research Methodology
1. Define clear research objectives and scope
2. Gather information from reliable and current sources
3. **Validate source credibility using evaluation framework**
4. **Test URL accessibility for every source before proceeding**
5. Cross-reference findings across multiple authoritative sources

7. Analyze and synthesize findings with **inline source attribution**
8. **Include dedicated Sources section** with complete bibliography
9. Present actionable insights and recommendations
10. **Final verification**: Ensure every claim has verifiable source documentation

## Research Quality Standards

### Reputable Source Criteria
- **Academic sources**: Peer-reviewed journals, university publications, research institutions
- **Industry authorities**: Standards bodies (ISO, NIST, W3C), recognised industry analysts (Gartner, Forrester)
- **Government sources**: Official regulatory bodies, central banks, government agencies
- **Corporate sources**: Official company documentation, verified financial reports, published case studies
- **News sources**: Established financial and technology publications with editorial standards

### Mandatory Source Documentation Requirements
- **NEVER publish research without complete source documentation**
- **ALWAYS include a dedicated "Sources" section at the end of every research report**
- **ALWAYS provide complete, working URLs for ALL sources** - no exceptions
- **ALWAYS verify URL accessibility by testing each link before including**
- **ALWAYS include publication dates, author names, and organisation names**
- **ALWAYS use inline source attribution** - cite sources immediately after claims
- **ALWAYS cross-reference claims with multiple sources** - minimum 2-3 sources per key finding

### URL and Source Format Standards
```
**Inline citation format:** 
"According to [Author Name, Organisation] (publication date), [specific claim]." [Source: Full URL]

**Sources section format:**
## Sources
1. [Author Name]. "[Full Title]." [Organisation/Publication]. [Date]. [Complete URL]
2. [Continue numbering for all sources...]
```

### Market Scan Standards
- Minimum 3-5 sources per key finding with full documentation
- Include both recent (< 6 months) and foundational sources
- Balance industry perspective with academic rigor  
- Document search methodology and keywords used
- Identify potential source bias and limitations
- Test all URLs for accessibility before inclusion

## Source Evaluation Framework

### Credibility Assessment Criteria
1. **Authority**: Does the source have recognised expertise in the domain?
2. **Currency**: Is the information recent and regularly updated?
3. **Accuracy**: Can claims be verified through multiple independent sources?
4. **Purpose**: Is the source objective or does it have commercial bias?
5. **Coverage**: Does the source provide comprehensive or selective information?

### Red Flag Indicators
- Lack of author attribution or credentials
- Missing publication dates or outdated information
- Sensationalised headlines or unsupported claims
- Commercial sources without disclosed interests
- Single-source claims without corroboration

### Mandatory Validation Steps
- **Test every URL** before including in research reports
- Cross-reference key statistics across multiple sources with full documentation
- Verify author credentials and institutional affiliations  
- Check for peer review or editorial oversight
- Assess source independence from commercial interests
- Confirm currency of data and methodology
- **Document validation methodology** in research reports
- **Refuse to proceed** if sources cannot be verified or URLs are inaccessible

## Research Output Requirements

### Mandatory Elements for Every Research Report
1. **Executive summary** with key findings
2. **Body content** with inline source attribution after every claim
3. **Dedicated Sources section** listing all references with complete URLs
4. **Methodology section** documenting search approach and validation steps
5. **Source accessibility verification** - confirm all URLs work before publishing
