# Project Moonpool Validation Phase

## Phase Overview

The validation phase serves as the **multi-agent review gate** between DDD-exempt discovery exploration and domain-governed codification. All concepts from discovery must pass through rigorous agent validation before entering the domain model.

## Validation Process

### Entry Criteria
Discovery phase documents are ready for validation when they contain:
- [ ] Complete research findings
- [ ] Validated assumptions  
- [ ] Clear business requirements
- [ ] Technical feasibility assessment
- [ ] User research insights

### Agent Review Requirements

**Mandatory Sign-offs Required:**
- **Platform Architect Agent** - Technical architecture validation
- **Security Agent** - Security and privacy review  
- **Product Strategy Agent** - Business model validation
- **Documentation Agent** - Terminology and consistency review

**Additional Reviews as Needed:**
- Market Research Agent (for market assumptions)
- Backend Developer (for technical implementation)
- Frontend Developer (for user experience validation)

### Validation Directories

#### `/concept-review/`
Initial concept validation from discovery findings
- Business model validation
- Value proposition confirmation  
- Market opportunity assessment

#### `/technical-feasibility/`
Technical architecture and implementation validation
- Platform Architect sign-off required
- Technology stack validation
- Scalability assessment
- Integration feasibility

#### `/architecture-review/`
Detailed architectural validation
- Hexagonal architecture compliance
- Domain boundary identification
- Port and adapter specifications
- Security architecture validation

#### `/security-assessment/`
Security Agent comprehensive review
- Privacy infrastructure validation
- Data protection compliance
- Authentication/authorization models
- Risk assessment and mitigation

#### `/agent-feedback/`
Multi-agent collaboration and feedback
- Cross-agent review coordination
- Conflict resolution
- Consensus building
- Final validation decisions

## Workflow Integration

### Discovery-to-Domain Translation Process

**CRITICAL FUNCTION:** This phase translates free-form discovery findings into domain-appropriate concepts.

**Translation Workflow:**
1. **Discovery Findings Review** - Collect all discovery documentation (any terminology, any framework)
2. **Domain Concept Mapping** - Identify business concepts that emerged during exploration
3. **Ubiquitous Language Creation** - Work with Documentation Agent to create domain terminology
4. **Bounded Context Identification** - Map business capabilities to potential domain boundaries
5. **Core Domain Classification** - Use Core Domain Charts to prioritize business value

**Key Translation Artifacts:**
- Discovery-to-Domain terminology mapping
- Business capability to bounded context mapping
- Core/Supporting/Generic domain classification
- Ubiquitous language glossary (first draft)
- Domain boundary proposals

### From Discovery
Discovery documents graduate to validation when:
1. Research objectives are met
2. Key assumptions are documented (not necessarily validated)
3. Business opportunities are identified
4. User needs are understood
5. Solution concepts are explored

### To Domain Codification  
Validated concepts enter domain modeling when:
1. All mandatory agent sign-offs completed
2. Technical feasibility confirmed
3. Security requirements validated  
4. Business model approved
5. Domain boundaries clearly defined
6. Ubiquitous language established
7. Discovery terminology successfully translated to domain concepts

## Agent System Integration

This validation phase uses Claude Code subagents from `.claude/agents/`:
- Multi-agent coordination through task-orchestrator
- Specialized review by platform-architect, security-reviewer, etc.
- Discovery-to-domain translation by documentation-guardian
- Quality gates enforced per agent specialization

**Current Status:** Framework established, awaiting discovery completion  
**Next Steps:** Complete discovery phase research before validation initiation
