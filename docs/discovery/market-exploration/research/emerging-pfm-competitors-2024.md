# Emerging PFM competitors 2024: Comprehensive competitive analysis

## Executive summary

The personal finance management (PFM) landscape experienced significant transformation in 2024, driven by AI integration, privacy concerns following major app closures, and substantial funding rounds despite broader fintech market cooling. The global PFM market, valued at $101 billion in 2023, is projected to reach $450.8 billion by 2030 (CAGR 24%). Key trends include the rise of AI-powered insights, privacy-focused alternatives, and demographic-specific solutions targeting Gen Z and millennials.

Monarch Money emerged as the clear funding winner with a $75 million Series B at $850 million valuation, capitalising on Mint's closure. Privacy-focused open-source alternatives like Actual Budget gained traction amongst security-conscious users. In Australia and New Zealand, sortme continued expanding its footprint whilst facing feature gaps in scenario planning and customisation that present opportunities for differentiation.

This analysis profiles 15+ emerging competitors across five categories: AI-powered platforms, privacy-first solutions, demographic-focused apps, neobank PFM features, and regional innovators. Strategic implications for Project Moonpool include opportunities in scenario planning, edge ML implementation, and holistic financial wellness features addressing the gaps identified in current market offerings.
