# Scenario Planning for Stressed Households: Research Analysis

# Scenario planning for the stressed: Why traditional financial tools fail and what actually works

The financial wellbeing landscape in Australia and New Zealand reveals a stark paradox: while governments pour hundreds of millions into financial capability programs and banks tout sophisticated planning tools, financially stressed households continue struggling with basic decisions. Our comprehensive research across academic literature, government data, and industry implementations uncovers why current approaches fail and identifies evidence-based opportunities for innovation.

**Bottom line upfront:** Traditional budgeting apps actually increase spending by 26-33%, while scenario planning tools that work brilliantly for corporations have zero peer-reviewed evidence of effectiveness for stressed households. The most promising opportunity lies in simplified, behaviorally-informed decision support tools focused on major life transitions—but only if they reduce rather than add to cognitive load. With $150 million in annual Australian government funding and a $1.11 trillion wealth transfer underway in New Zealand, the market is primed for evidence-based innovation that actually changes financial outcomes.

## The decision fatigue trap crushing financial planning

Financial stress fundamentally impairs decision-making quality through well-documented psychological mechanisms. Recent Australian research reveals **17% of households cannot raise $2,000 for emergencies**, with single parents and low-income families experiencing triple the financial shock burden of average households. This creates what Dean Spears calls a "poverty trap" where the very people who most need good financial planning are least capable of it.

The mechanism is straightforward but devastating. Financial stress consumes mental resources through constant trade-offs—a phenomenon researchers term "decision fatigue." Scottish Widows found that while **52% of consumers ensure the best choice for holiday destinations**, only **29% apply similar diligence to pension arrangements**. The cognitive overload of managing tight finances leaves little mental capacity for forward planning. Mental accounting compounds the problem, with people segregating money into rigid categories that prevent optimal resource allocation.

Most critically, this research reveals **only 10% of financially stressed Australian households seek professional financial advice**, indicating widespread decision avoidance behaviors. The Russell et al. (2025) scoping review found up to **68% of Australian students experience significant financial difficulty**, with **96% reporting high emotional stress** that creates "decision paralysis" when choosing between basic needs. These aren't edge cases—they represent a substantial portion of the population traditional financial tools fail to serve.

## Where scenario planning works brilliantly (and where it doesn't)

Corporate scenario planning demonstrates remarkable success, with **86% of CFOs reporting increased strategic decision-making speed**. Organizations use sophisticated modeling to navigate uncertainty, test strategies, and build resilience. The Reserve Bank of Australia employs complex scenario analysis showing how interest rate changes affect household resilience across multiple variables and time horizons.

Yet our research uncovered a glaring gap: **no peer-reviewed studies demonstrate effectiveness of scenario planning tools for financially stressed households** in Australia or New Zealand. The Cropper & Cowton (2023) study found even well-resourced universities feel "uncertain whether they were adopting the right approach" to scenario planning, with little sharing of best practices. If institutions struggle with implementation, expecting stressed households to benefit from similar complexity seems unrealistic.

The absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, but it reveals a critical disconnect. Tools designed for corporate strategic planning assume cognitive resources, time horizons, and decision-making frameworks that financially stressed households simply don't possess. As the Australian Psychological Society notes, financial stress "consumes mental resources, making it harder to focus on other areas of life such as work, relationships, or personal goals."

## How Australia and New Zealand are redefining financial wellbeing

Leading researchers have abandoned traditional budgeting approaches for holistic frameworks emphasizing control, security, and future orientation. The UNSW framework, based on 821 survey respondents and 72 qualitative interviews, identifies three dimensions: **meeting expenses with money left over, being in control, and feeling financially secure**. Critically, this moves beyond tracking dollars to addressing psychological needs.

The Melbourne Institute's groundbreaking collaboration with Commonwealth Bank created both "Reported" and "Observed" financial wellbeing scales, analyzing **5+ million customer records** alongside self-assessments. This dual approach reveals that approximately **one-third of Australians aren't on track to secure their financial future**, despite many feeling financially comfortable day-to-day.

New Zealand's Te Ara Ahunga Ora framework explicitly rejects traditional capability measures, instead focusing on "tangible actions people can take to shift their financial wellbeing." Their analysis of over 90 international research papers concluded that **behavioral interventions vastly outperform financial literacy education**. ANZ research confirms this, finding two behaviors—**active saving and not borrowing for everyday expenses**—could increase financial wellbeing by over 26% regardless of income level.

These frameworks share a critical insight: financial wellbeing isn't about perfect budgeting but about building adaptive capacity for life's uncertainties. The focus shifts from information provision to behavior change, from universal solutions to life-stage appropriate interventions.

## What technology approaches actually change behavior (hint: it's not what banks think)

The Irrational Labs randomized controlled trial with 9,035 participants delivered devastating findings for traditional fintech: **budgeting apps showing "remaining budget" information increase spending by 26-33%**. Users treat visible balances as spending goals, consistently overspending by 1.3-1.4 times intended amounts. Increased app engagement correlated with worse, not better, financial outcomes.

This "licensing effect" extends beyond budgeting. Research identifies that using financial apps can create "moral licensing" where users feel justified making poor financial decisions because they're "being responsible" by tracking spending. The say-do gap proves enormous—**100% of retirement seminar attendees plan to enroll in employer plans, but only 14% actually do**.

What does work? Meta-analysis of choice architecture interventions shows **nudging and behavioral design significantly outperform information-based approaches**, particularly for low-income users. Default options drive massive behavior change—401k enrollment increased 28 percentage points through active choice requirements alone. Successful approaches share common elements: **simplification over complexity, behavioral triggers over education, ongoing support over one-time interventions**.

Artificial intelligence shows promise when integrated with behavioral science principles, not as standalone solutions. Over **90% of financial services organizations report positive revenue impact** from AI implementation, but this primarily reflects operational efficiency rather than customer behavior change. The key lies in using AI to personalize behavioral interventions, not just provide more sophisticated calculations.

## Market transformation signals $150 million opportunity

Australia's financial wellbeing sector is experiencing unprecedented government investment. The Financial Wellbeing and Capability Activity increased to **$150 million annually starting October 2025**, supporting an estimated 500,000 Australians through 300+ grant recipients. The new Financial Wellbeing Hubs program adds **$95.1 million over five years** for integrated services focusing on early intervention.

Housing affordability drives much of this investment. Only **1% of Australian homes remain affordable to low-income households**, with Sydney's median house price reaching $1.3 million. Young adults bear the brunt—**28% of 15-24 year-olds in lower income households experience housing stress**, with only **16% of 18-34 year-olds satisfied** with their housing situation. These aren't temporary challenges but structural shifts requiring new financial planning approaches.

New Zealand faces similar pressures alongside a **$1.11 trillion intergenerational wealth transfer** over the next 20 years. Those born before 1966 hold **60% of the nation's $2.29 trillion individual net wealth**, creating both opportunities and inequalities. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's new Financial Inclusion Indicators, launched July 2025, specifically track how well the financial system serves diverse community needs.

Demographic shifts create specific opportunities. First Nations communities receive targeted funding through dedicated grant programs. CALD (Culturally and Linguistically Diverse) communities, often underserved by traditional financial services, are priority populations for government-funded programs. The gig economy's growth demands tools for irregular income patterns—a gap current solutions don't address.

## Why banks succeed at measurement but fail at behavior change

Commonwealth Bank's Financial Wellbeing program demonstrates both the promise and limitations of current approaches. Analyzing **5+ million customers** (over 25% of Australian adults), they've created robust measurement frameworks and achieved impressive engagement—their Benefits Finder helped customers collect **$500+ million in unclaimed benefits**. Yet translating engagement into sustained behavior change remains elusive.

ANZ's programs show similar patterns. Their Saver Plus matched savings program achieves remarkable long-term results—**84% of participants still save regularly 7+ years after completion**. But this intensive, high-touch program serves only 61,000 participants over multiple years. When ANZ launched a Financial Wellbeing 6-week Challenge, 18,000 signed up but completion rates remain undisclosed—a telling omission.

The broader industry landscape reveals systemic challenges. Bank-fintech partnerships fail at alarming rates—**40% of surveyed banks report partnership failure rates between 20-40%**, with nearly one-third experiencing over 40% failure rates. Common failure points include poor go-to-market strategies, regulatory compliance complexities, and mismatched operational needs. Banks excel at building infrastructure but struggle to create solutions that change day-to-day financial behaviors.

Social enterprise models show promise but face sustainability challenges. The Social Enterprise Development Initiative positively impacted 9,051 people, but the sector remains "grant-dependent," creating intense competition for limited capital. Indigenous-led innovations like First Nations Finance, which directs **70% of profits to mental health, education, and employment support**, demonstrate alternative models but need patient capital to scale.

## Validating the scenario planning hypothesis: Yes, but...

Our research partially validates the hypothesis that forward-looking scenario planning tools would benefit financially stressed households—but with critical caveats. The evidence suggests these tools could work if fundamentally reimagined for the cognitive and emotional realities of financial stress.

**What won't work:** Complex multi-scenario modeling resembling corporate planning tools. Adding analytical complexity to already-overwhelmed individuals worsens decision fatigue. The absence of peer-reviewed evidence for household-level effectiveness, despite widespread corporate adoption, speaks volumes.

**What might work:** Simplified decision support for specific life transitions. Research identifies **59 distinct life transitions affecting financial wellbeing**, from marriage and parenthood to career changes and retirement. Tools that help navigate these specific moments—when people are already reconsidering finances—show more promise than general planning applications.

**Critical design principles emerge:**- **Reduce choices rather than multiply scenarios**: Combat choice overload with intelligent defaults- **Focus on next steps, not distant futures**: Stressed individuals can't plan beyond immediate needs- **Integrate social support**: Strongest evidence supports peer and professional guidance- **Build habits, not just provide information**: Behavioral change requires consistent reinforcement- **Address structural barriers**: Tools alone can't overcome systemic financial pressures

## Five evidence-based opportunities for product development

### 1. Life transition navigation tools

Create simplified scenario tools for specific transitions: buying first homes, having children, changing careers, or managing relationship changes. Focus on immediate decisions with long-term implications rather than abstract future planning. The housing affordability crisis makes home-buying scenarios particularly relevant.

### 2. Behavioral nudge platforms with AI personalization

Leverage AI to identify personal financial stress patterns and deliver timely behavioral interventions. Move beyond budgeting to active saving prompts, spending pause mechanisms, and intelligent defaults. Remember: **simple nudges outperform complex analytics**.

### 3. Social support integration systems

Build tools that connect financial planning with peer support networks. ANZ's Saver Plus success demonstrates the power of combining financial tools with human connection. Consider partnerships with employers, community organizations, or government programs for delivery channels.

### 4. Irregular income smoothing solutions

Address the gig economy gap with tools that help manage variable income through intelligent buffering, automated saving during high-income periods, and stress-tested minimum expense planning. No current solutions adequately serve this growing demographic.

### 5. Culturally-adapted financial resilience tools

Develop specific solutions for First Nations communities, CALD populations, and other underserved groups. Partner with community organizations for culturally appropriate delivery. Government funding specifically targets these populations, providing both market opportunity and social impact.

## Implementation roadmap: Start simple, measure everything

Success requires abandoning the "build it and they will come" mentality that plagues financial tools. Instead, follow the evidence:

**Phase 1: Validate with specific use cases.** Choose one life transition or demographic segment. Build the simplest possible tool that reduces decision complexity. Test with real stressed households, not proxy populations.

**Phase 2: Measure behavioral outcomes, not engagement.** Track actual saving increases, debt reduction, or financial resilience improvements. Engagement metrics mislead—the Irrational Labs study showed high engagement correlating with worse outcomes.

**Phase 3: Integrate with existing trusted channels.** Financial Wellbeing Hubs, employer programs, and community organizations provide established delivery mechanisms. Building trust from scratch wastes resources financially stressed users don't have.

**Phase 4: Iterate based on behavioral data.** Use AI to identify what actually drives behavior change for different user segments. Resist feature creep—complexity kills adoption among stressed populations.

**Phase 5: Scale through partnerships, not just technology.** The most successful programs combine digital tools with human support. Plan for sustainable funding models beyond initial grants.

## The uncomfortable truth about financial wellbeing innovation

The research reveals an uncomfortable truth: the financial services industry excels at building sophisticated tools for people who don't need them while failing those who do. Stressed households don't need more complex planning tools—they need solutions that reduce cognitive load while building financial resilience.

The opportunity isn't in replicating corporate scenario planning for households but in reimagining decision support for the reality of financial stress. With substantial government funding, demographic shifts creating new needs, and clear evidence of what doesn't work, the market is primed for evidence-based innovation.

Success will come not from the most sophisticated technology but from the deepest understanding of human behavior under financial stress. The winners will be those who resist the temptation to add complexity and instead focus relentlessly on simplifying financial decisions at life's critical moments. In a market drowning in failed complexity, simplicity isn't just a design principle—it's a competitive advantage.
