# Reddit competitive scan: Personal finance management tools in Australia and New Zealand (2023-2024)

## Executive summary

The Australian and New Zealand PFM landscape underwent significant consolidation during 2023-2024, with major players PocketBook and MoneyBrilliant closing operations. This market disruption created opportunities for surviving platforms like Frollo, WeMoney, and PocketSmith to capture displaced users. Reddit discussions reveal strong preferences for YNAB's methodology despite its higher cost, while local solutions struggle with balancing feature richness against privacy concerns.

Key findings indicate a bifurcated market: technically sophisticated users gravitate towards international solutions (YNAB, spreadsheets), while mainstream users seek local bank integration through apps like Frollo and Up Bank. Open Banking adoption accelerated following the closures, though security concerns remain a significant barrier to adoption.

### Negative themes and concerns

**Security and privacy**
"Maybe I'm old school but if I want to do a personal budget or look at my finances I still use Microsoft Excel or a Google Sheet. There is no way I would give a budgeting app access to my online banking" - OzBargain user. [Source: OzBargain Forums, "Frollo (Personal Finance and Budgeting App) - Any Feedback?", https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/516027]

Security professionals report abandoning apps after "discovering the way they work" and now "advise others to strongly consider the risks".

**Platform instability**
The closures of PocketBook and MoneyBrilliant created significant user anxiety about platform longevity. Users express concern about investing time in apps that may disappear.

**Cost sensitivity**
Subscription fatigue evident in discussions, with many users reluctant to pay monthly fees for budgeting tools, particularly in cost-of-living crisis context.

## Market gaps identified

### Integration limitations
- **Cross-border functionality**: Limited solutions for AU/NZ citizens with accounts in both countries
- **Joint account support**: Many Open Banking implementations don't support joint accounts
- **Super/KiwiSaver integration**: Poor visibility of retirement savings in budgeting contexts

### Feature gaps
- **Energy cost integration**: No apps integrate real-time energy pricing for household budget optimisation
- **Life event modelling**: Absence of tools for major financial decisions (home buying, career changes)
- **Time economics**: No consideration of time value in financial decision-making

### User experience gaps
- **Complexity barrier**: Gap between simple trackers and complex tools like YNAB
- **Financial literacy**: Limited educational content within apps
- **Personalisation**: One-size-fits-all approaches don't address diverse financial situations

## Open Banking and regulatory context

### Consumer Data Right progress
The Australian Government invested $88.8 million over 2023-24 to support CDR expansion across banking, energy, and non-bank lending sectors. Over 100 data holder brands actively share data, with 80+ organisations accessing as Accredited Data Recipients. [Source: Consumer Data Right, "CDR Strategic Review July 2024", https://www.cdr.gov.au/rollout]

### Implementation challenges
- Non-bank lenders joining CDR in November 2024
- Action initiation capabilities expected 2024-2025
- Joint account support remains inconsistent
- Some institutions rely on screen scraping despite Open Banking availability

## Recommendations for further analysis

2. **Stability messaging**: Emphasise long-term viability through sustainable business model communication

3. **Education integration**: Bridge the feature gap with integrated financial literacy components

### Technical investigations
