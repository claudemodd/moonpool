# Lean Canvas: Project Moonpool

**Date**: 12 August 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Target Segment**: Financially stressed young families (25-45) managing complex life transitions in Australia and New Zealand

---

## 1. Problem
**Top 3 Problems**

1. **Decision Paralysis**: 30.8% of AU mortgage holders in stress cannot model "what-if" scenarios for major life decisions (housing, career, children) due to cognitive overload and lack of forward-looking tools

2. **Hidden Cost Blindness**: Families cannot see true costs including time, energy, and opportunity costs - leading to suboptimal decisions that worsen financial stress

3. **Crisis Mode Trap**: 55% of NZ population struggling financially operate reactively, with existing tools adding complexity when users need simplification most

**Existing Alternatives**:
- Spreadsheets (complex, time-consuming)
- Traditional budgeting apps (backward-looking, increase spending by 26-33%)
- Financial advisors (unaffordable for target segment)
- Doing nothing (status quo for 80% who never seek help)
