# Project Moonpool Discovery Documentation

> **DDD-Exempt exploration space for unrestricted research**  
> **COMPLETE FREEDOM ZONE: Use any terminology, frameworks, or approaches**

## Discovery Areas

### Market Exploration
Research and analysis specific to Project Moonpool's market opportunity:
- Target market identification
- Competitive landscape analysis  
- Market size and opportunity assessment
- User behavior patterns and needs

### Product Discovery
Product concepts and feature exploration for Moonpool:
- Core product vision and concepts
- Feature ideation and prioritization
- User journey mapping
- Product-market fit validation

### User Interviews
Direct user research and feedback collection:
- User interview summaries
- Feedback synthesis and insights
- User persona development
- Pain point identification

## Documentation Workflow

1. **Create/Edit** markdown files in discovery directories
2. **Collaborate** using your preferred tools for reviews and comments
3. **Iterate** on insights and findings as understanding develops
4. **Commit** to git for version control and team coordination

## Agent System Integration

While discovery is DDD-exempt, transition guidance available from:
- Claude Code subagents in `.claude/agents/` provide discovery coordination
- Validation phase agents handle discovery-to-domain translation
- Domain phase agents enforce established domain concepts

## Discovery Freedom Guidelines

**EXPLICIT PERMISSIONS - You CAN and SHOULD:**
- Use any terminology and language (technical, business, industry-standard)
- Apply external frameworks (Lean Canvas, Jobs-to-be-Done, Design Thinking, etc.)
- Create unstructured notes, observations, and brainstorming documents
- Use industry-standard product and market terminology
- Reference competitors using their own language and concepts
- Explore tangential ideas and "what-if" scenarios
- Document assumptions, hypotheses, and incomplete thoughts
- Mix qualitative insights with quantitative data
- Use visual thinking tools (mind maps, sketches, diagrams)
- Iterate rapidly without documentation consistency requirements

**DISCOVERY ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:**
- ❌ Don't force early domain terminology
- ❌ Don't worry about bounded contexts yet
- ❌ Don't constrain thinking to "pure" business logic
- ❌ Don't enforce architectural patterns
- ❌ Don't require formal documentation structure
- ❌ Don't limit exploration to "known" solutions

**Translation to Domain:** All discovery findings will be properly translated to domain concepts during the validation phase - NOT during discovery.

**Next Steps:**
1. Begin market exploration research
2. Document initial product concepts
3. Plan and conduct user interviews
4. Sync findings to Notion for collaborative review
